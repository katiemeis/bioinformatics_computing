Homework 3

1. python generate_rolls.py -o generated_rolls_1.txt

Writes random sequence of 300 rolls to -o option (generated_rolls_1.txt)


2. Files in hw3 folder, named hw3_1.txt and hw_2.txt


3. Probability code
python calc_prob.py -i hw3_1.txt
output is: 2.71995343569e-232

python calc_prob.py -i hw3_2.txt
output is: 1.93533032023e-232

*these aren't the same answers Scott put online, but when I changed the transition probability of loaded to fair to be the same as fair to loaded I got the old answers he had confirmed so I believe these numbers are correct. 


4. Viterbi code
python viterbi.py -i hw3_1.txt -o viterbi.1.txt
python viterbi.py -i hw3_2.txt -o viterbi.2.txt


5. Files are in hw3 folder, named virulent_anth.fasta and non_virulent_anth.fasta.


6. Dowloaded and unpacked GLIMMer using instructions provided on the site. 


7. GLIMMer output files for Anthrax genomes in hw3 folder, named virulent.predict and nonvirulent.predit. All other output files are in hw3/glimmer_files if needed.
