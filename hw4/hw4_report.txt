5. nucmer virulent_anth.fasta non_virulent_anth.fasta -p ames

6. show-snps -C ames.delta > snps_results.txt

mummerplot --filter ames.delta
procuded files out.filter, out.fplot, out.gp, out.rplot

dnadiff -d ames.delta
produced files out.1coords, out.1delta, out.mcoors, out.mdelta, out.qdiff, out.rdiff, out.report, out.snps

All output files in mummer_results directory

7. The out.report file shows that there are 19 snips and 12 indels. Their overall length (total number of bases) is very close as are all other comparisons at the top of the out.report file. There could be an inversion in a part of the sequence or a small insert that makes the difference. 
*results slightly different than show-snps results, this file is in dropbox too.

8. minimus influenza-A.afg
Output files for influenza_A in minimus_results/influenza_test

9. minimus SE_test.afg
Output files for SE_test.afg in minumus_results/SE_test_results

10. nucmer camp_ref.fasta SE_test.fasta
Output file SE_out.delta in SE_nucmer_compare directory

11. dnadiff -d SE_out.delta
Outputs files in SE_nucmer_compare directory
Found number of contigs from SE_test.fasta
Found average contig length by wc -c SE_test.fasta, subtract numbers and >s, divide by number of contigs
Also did avg contig length looking at total bases of qry in out.report, divide by 230 -> number is different (about 8500 instead of about 8700)

The SE_test.fasta file shows that there are 230 contigs in the assembly. The average contig size would be about 8500 bases. The out.report file shows that there are 21 snps and 45 indels. I'm not sure whether or not this is a good assembly. I think some things to look at would be the number of contigs, their average length, the total length of all the contigs. I can do this with the output, but have no reference to determine if they're good or bad. Maybe these are way shorter than expected and we have a whole bunch of them, so we might think it's a bad assembly, or there's a smaller number of contigs than average that are long so it's a good assembly. I just have nothing to inform my expectations. It also looks like there are a lot more indels and a bigger difference in overall length in this one than in the Anthrax comparison so maybe that tells us the assembly isn't as good (or just this sequence isn't as close to the reference as Ames is to Ames ancestor, I'm not sure if the one we assembled should be exactly the same as the reference if assembled 100% correctly).
