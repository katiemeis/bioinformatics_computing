Homework 2

Used Python 2.7, numpy for all

1. Files located in hw2 directory named fly_gene.fasta and human_gene.fasta.


2. python globalign.py -i human_gene.fasta -f fly_gene.fasta -o global_alignment.txt

Prints out optimal alignment score and writes alignment to -o option (global_alignment.txt)
"Optimal alignment score is: -1016.0"


3. python localign.py -i human_gene.fasta -f fly_gene.fasta -o local_alignment.txt

Prints out optimal alignment score and writes alignment to -o option (local_alignment.txt)
"Optimal alignment score is: 820.0"

Local alignment is different from global alignment in that you are matching a query to a substring of the other sequence instad of doing an end to end alignment.
Local alignment is more useful in cases where two sequences are dissimilar but may contain regions that have been conserved or are similar. 
Global alignment would be better used for comparing homologous genes that are overall very similar, for example.
In this case, it looks like local alignment performs better than global alignment as the optimal alignment score is much higher. This would suggest that
only portions of these two genes are closely similar. 


4. python egfalign.py -i human_mito.fasta -o neander_sample.fasta

Prints out optimal alignment score
"Optimal alignment score is: 620.0"


5. I used blast to align the fly and human sequences, the fly being the subject and the human being the query. 
The results show what looks like two local alignments - the beginning of the human sequence (bp 11-408) aligns to bp 198-595 of the
fly sequence with a score of 235, identity of 73%, and e value of 4e-65. The second local alignment is between bp 625-828 of the human gene and
1316-1519 of the fly gene, with a lower score of 102, e value of 6e-25, and identity of 71%. Overall, the total score was 337 and the query
cover was 47%. This backs up what would be expected from the results of the global and local alignments from problems 2 and 3.

6. It looks like this sequence is sonic hedgehog.
The top hit had a max score of 17378, 100% query cover and identiy, and 0.0 e value.  
Top hit was "Homo sapiens sonic hedgehog (SHH), RefSeqGene on chromosome 7"
